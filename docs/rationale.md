So, why create prospect?

1. You don't like mailchimp or other providers that handle mailing lists or
   feel comfortable keeping up with your prospective and actual customers
   internally. This creates a need to maintain a simple database of your
   contacts and mailing lists.

2. You don't trust or agree with the terms of service that other companies
   have and want to protect your data.

3. You're prospecting, and want to maintain research on each potential customer,
   which may include phone calls and meetings.

4. You're planning to integrate this with a single-use mailer like [0box](https://github.com/lakesite/0box)
   and using the system to reach out to prospective customers.
   
What this shouldn't be used for (but might anyway):

1. Bulk unsolicited e-mail.
